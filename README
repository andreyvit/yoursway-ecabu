ecabu â€” the lightweight Eclipse plugins builder
===============================================

Does handle:
- multiple source and binary sources
- fragments (but see below)
- version numbering and qualifier substitution

Does not handle:
- features
- checking out the sources from a VCS

Installing ecabu
----------------

1. Git-clone (or download and extract) to where you want ecabu to *live*
(i.e. not to a temporary location).

2. Run "sudo ./install /usr/local/bin" to put ecabu shell script into the
specified folder. (The shell script will have a hard-coded path to ecabu.rb,
which should be in the same folder as the installer script.)


Using ecabu
-----------

A sample invokation is provided, see the "sample" shell script. Basically,
you need to specify some sources (where ecabu should look for plugins), and
then what plugins you want to include into the build (you can automatically
include some of the sources, or you can include/exclude using shell glob
patterns).

You also must specify the output directory.


Handling fragments
------------------

Note that ecabu does not parse all the plugins in the source directories
(this would take more time), so it will only include those fragments it will
encounter. Unless someone references a fragment in Require-Bundle (is this
possible?), the only fragments that will be encountered are the fragments
you've explicitly included into the build.

This means that most Eclipse applications will need to explicitly include SWT
fragment using "--include 'org.eclipse.swt.*'" -- unless, of course, you
include the entire platform (using "--include-following" before specifying
"--binary <path-to-platform-plugins>").
